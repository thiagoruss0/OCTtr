# Retinal Vascular Occlusions: OCT Analysis Protocol

## Overview

Retinal vein occlusions (RVO) include branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). OCT is essential for detecting macular edema, assessing ischemia, and predicting visual outcomes.

---

## Classification

### Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)

**Non-Ischemic (Perfused)**:
- Better visual prognosis
- Lower neovascularization risk
- Macular edema often treatment-responsive

**Ischemic (Non-Perfused)**:
- Poor visual prognosis
- High neovascularization risk (NVI, NVG)
- Extensive capillary nonperfusion on FA/OCTA
- Macular edema may persist despite treatment

### Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO)

- Follows venous distribution
- Typically sectoral involvement
- Better overall prognosis than CRVO
- Superotemporal most common

### Hemiretinal Vein Occlusion (HRVO)

- Involvement of superior or inferior hemisphere
- Intermediate between BRVO and CRVO
- Shares features of both

---

## OCT Assessment Protocol

### Step 1: Macular Edema Evaluation

**Center Involvement**:
- Determine if central subfield is involved
- Measure central subfield thickness (CST)
- Center-involved edema guides treatment decision

**Edema Pattern**:
| Pattern | Description | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Cystoid | Well-defined cystic spaces | Most common |
| Diffuse | Spongy thickening | May coexist |
| SRF | Subretinal fluid | Activity marker |

**Edema Extent**:
- Sectoral (BRVO pattern)
- Diffuse (CRVO pattern)
- Measure affected area on thickness map

---

### Step 2: Structural Biomarkers

**DRIL Assessment**:
- Disorganization of inner layers
- Measure extent in central 1mm
- Strong predictor of VA outcome
- May persist after edema resolution

**Outer Retinal Bands**:
| Band | Assessment | Significance |
|------|------------|--------------|
| ELM | Intact/Disrupted/Absent | Better VA at 6 months if intact |
| EZ | Intact/Disrupted/Absent | Better VA at 12 months if intact |

**HRF (Hyperreflective Foci)**:
- Indicates inflammation/hemorrhage products
- Associated with disease activity
- May represent extravasated blood components

---

### Step 3: Hemorrhage Assessment

**OCT Appearance**:
- Hyperreflective material in various layers
- May cause shadowing
- Intraretinal hemorrhage: within retinal layers
- Subretinal hemorrhage: between retina and RPE

**Impact**:
- Dense hemorrhage limits OCT interpretation
- May obscure underlying structures
- Resolution allows better assessment

---

### Step 4: Ischemia Markers (OCTA Correlation)

**Foveal Avascular Zone (FAZ)**:
| Finding | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Enlarged FAZ | Macular ischemia |
| Irregular FAZ | Capillary dropout |
| Normal FAZ | Non-ischemic macula |

**Capillary Nonperfusion**:
- Dark areas on OCTA
- Extent correlates with ischemia severity
- Predicts neovascularization risk

**Key Point**: Macular ischemia + edema = guarded visual prognosis

---

### Step 5: Additional Findings

**Cotton Wool Spots**:
- RNFL infarcts
- Appear as hyperreflective thickening in RNFL
- Resolve over weeks

**Collateral Vessels**:
- Bypass blocked veins
- Visible on OCTA
- May develop over time

**Epiretinal Membrane**:
- May develop secondary to RVO
- Can complicate edema management

---

## Prognostic Biomarkers

### Systematic Review Evidence (2025)

**Predictors of Better VA at 6 Months**:
- Intact ELM at baseline (Low certainty evidence)

**Predictors of Better VA at 12 Months**:
- Intact EZ at baseline (Low certainty evidence)

**General Prognostic Factors**:
| Favorable | Unfavorable |
|-----------|-------------|
| Intact ELM | Disrupted ELM |
| Intact EZ | Disrupted EZ |
| No DRIL | DRIL >500µm |
| Normal FAZ | Enlarged/irregular FAZ |
| Limited nonperfusion | Extensive nonperfusion |

---

## Treatment Response Assessment

### Response Criteria

**Good Response**:
- CST decrease >10%
- Resolution of SRF
- Cyst reduction
- VA improvement

**Partial Response**:
- Some anatomic improvement
- Persistent edema
- Limited VA gain

**Poor Response**:
- Persistent/worsening edema
- No VA improvement
- Consider macular ischemia as cause

---

### Differentiating Ischemic vs. Non-Ischemic

**OCT/OCTA Indicators**:
| Feature | Non-Ischemic | Ischemic |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| FAZ | Normal | Enlarged/irregular |
| Capillary density | Preserved | Reduced |
| Treatment response | Usually good | Often limited |
| DRIL | May be absent/mild | Often present |

**Clinical Importance**:
- Ischemic CRVO: 10× higher NVI risk
- Macular ischemia limits visual recovery regardless of edema resolution

---

## Monitoring Protocol

### Acute Phase (First 6 Months)

**CRVO**:
- Monthly initially
- Monitor for neovascularization
- Assess treatment response

**BRVO**:
- Monthly to every 6 weeks
- Treatment as needed based on OCT

### Maintenance Phase

- Follow treat-and-extend protocols
- Monitor for recurrence
- Watch for complications (NV, ERM)

### Long-Term

- Annual screening for fellow eye
- Systemic workup (HTN, DM, hypercoagulability)

## OCTA Specific Findings

### Superficial Capillary Plexus (SCP)
- Capillary dropout areas
- Vessel tortuosity
- Collateral formation

### Deep Capillary Plexus (DCP)
- Often more affected than SCP
- Correlates with edema
- Better predictor of chronicity

### Choriocapillaris
- Usually preserved in RVO
- Helps differentiate from other conditions

## Differential Considerations

### CME with Similar Appearance
- Irvine-Gass (post-surgical)
- Diabetic macular edema
- Uveitic CME

### Key Differentiators for RVO
- Sectoral hemorrhage pattern (BRVO)
- Venous tortuosity/dilation
- Cotton wool spots
