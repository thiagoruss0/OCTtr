# Treatment Protocols Reference

## Disclaimer

This document provides general reference information based on published guidelines and clinical trial data. Treatment decisions must be individualized based on complete clinical assessment. Always verify current guidelines as standards evolve.

---

## Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)

### Indications for Treatment

**Center-Involved DME with Vision Loss**:
- CST above device-specific threshold
- Vision reduction attributable to DME
- No contraindications to treatment

**Observation May Be Appropriate**:
- CI-DME with good vision (20/25 or better)
- Non-center-involved DME
- Recent significant improvement

---

### Anti-VEGF Agents for DME

| Agent | Dosing | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Aflibercept (Eylea) | 2mg monthly or q8 weeks after loading | VIEW 1&2 |
| Ranibizumab (Lucentis) | 0.3mg or 0.5mg monthly | RISE/RIDE |
| Bevacizumab (Avastin) | 1.25mg monthly | DRCR.net Protocol T |
| Brolucizumab (Beovu) | 6mg q8-12 weeks after loading | KESTREL/KITE |
| Faricimab (Vabysmo) | 6mg, up to q16 weeks | YOSEMITE/RHINE |
| Aflibercept HD (Eylea HD) | 8mg, up to q16 weeks after loading | PHOTON |

---

### Treatment Regimens

**Monthly Fixed Dosing**:
- Monthly injections indefinitely
- Maximum efficacy demonstrated in trials
- High treatment burden

**Pro Re Nata (PRN)**:
- Monthly monitoring
- Treat only when disease active
- May undertreat some patients

**Treat-and-Extend (T&E)**:
- Extend intervals when stable
- Reduce interval when active
- Balances efficacy and burden
- Currently preferred approach

---

### Treatment Response Assessment

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Good response | Continue, consider extending interval |
| Partial response (after 3-6 doses) | Consider switching agent or adding steroid |
| Poor/no response (after 6 doses) | Switch class, consider steroid |
| Recurrence | Resume/intensify treatment |

---

### Corticosteroids for DME

**Indications**:
- Inadequate response to anti-VEGF
- Pseudophakic patients
- Post-surgical inflammation component
- Patient preference/access issues

**Options**:
| Agent | Duration | Considerations |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex) | ~3-4 months | IOP rise, cataract progression |
| Fluocinolone implant (Iluvien) | ~36 months | High IOP risk, pseudophakic preferred |
| Triamcinolone (off-label) | ~3 months | IOP risk, cataract |

---

## Neovascular AMD (nAMD)

### Anti-VEGF Options

| Agent | Dosing | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Aflibercept (Eylea) | 2mg monthly x3, then q8 weeks | Standard of care |
| Ranibizumab (Lucentis) | 0.5mg monthly | Original anti-VEGF for nAMD |
| Bevacizumab (Avastin) | 1.25mg monthly | Off-label, cost-effective |
| Brolucizumab (Beovu) | 6mg monthly x3, then q8-12 weeks | IOI risk consideration |
| Faricimab (Vabysmo) | 6mg monthly x4, then q8-16 weeks | Dual mechanism |
| Aflibercept HD (Eylea HD) | 8mg monthly x3, then q8-16 weeks | Extended durability |

---

### Treatment Approach

**Loading Phase**:
- Typically monthly injections x 3-4
- Establishes anatomic response

**Maintenance**:
- Fixed dosing, PRN, or T&E
- T&E increasingly preferred
- Individualize based on response

**Treatment Goals**:
- Fluid resolution (especially IRF)
- VA stabilization/improvement
- Prevent structural damage

---

### Monitoring Parameters

| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Fluid free | Consider extending interval |
| New/increased fluid | Treat, consider shortening interval |
| Stable minimal SRF | May tolerate in some T&E protocols |
| IRF | Treat aggressively |
| Fibrosis/atrophy | Consider treatment impact on prognosis |

---

## Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO)

### Anti-VEGF for RVO-Associated Macular Edema

| Agent | Indication | Evidence |
|-------|------------|----------|
| Aflibercept | BRVO, CRVO | VIBRANT, COPERNICUS, GALILEO |
| Ranibizumab | BRVO, CRVO | BRAVO, CRUISE |
| Bevacizumab | BRVO, CRVO (off-label) | SCORE2 |
| Faricimab | BRVO, CRVO | BALATON, COMINO |

---

### Treatment Protocol

**Initial Management**:
- Monthly anti-VEGF until stable
- Typically 3-6 monthly injections minimum

**Maintenance**:
- T&E approach
- Monitor for recurrence
- May require extended treatment

**Alternative/Adjunctive**:
- Dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex) - FDA approved for RVO
- Laser (primarily BRVO, non-center-involved)

---

### Monitoring Considerations

- Monitor for neovascularization (especially CRVO)
- Assess ischemia status
- Watch for IOP in steroid-treated eyes
- Consider systemic workup referral

---

## Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC)

### Acute CSC

**Management**:
- Observation for 3-4 months (often self-resolves)
- Discontinue corticosteroids if possible
- Risk factor modification (stress, sleep hygiene)

**When to Treat**:
- Persistent >3-4 months
- Occupational requirements
- Recurrent episodes
- Fellow eye involvement with poor outcome

---

### Chronic CSC

**Treatment Options**:

| Treatment | Mechanism | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Half-fluence PDT | Choroidal remodeling | Most evidence |
| Half-dose PDT | Reduced fluence and dose | Lower complication risk |
| MR antagonists | Reduce fluid | Eplerenone, spironolactone - investigational |
| Anti-VEGF | Limited role | May help if MNV component |
| Thermal laser | Focal leak treatment | Limited use, risk of scarring |

---

### Monitoring

- Regular OCT follow-up
- Monitor for chronic changes
- Watch for MNV development

---

## Macular Telangiectasia Type 2 (MacTel)

### Important Principle

**Non-neovascular MacTel does NOT respond to anti-VEGF or steroids**

---

### Management

**Observation**:
- No proven treatment for non-neovascular disease
- Monitor progression
- Low vision support as needed

**For SRNV (Stage 4)**:
- Anti-VEGF treatment
- Similar approach to nAMD
- Only indication for injection therapy in MacTel

**Investigational**:
- CNTF (ciliary neurotrophic factor) - research stage
- Neuroprotection strategies under study

---

## Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV)

### Treatment Approaches

**Anti-VEGF Monotherapy**:
- Effective for many patients
- Standard initial approach

**Combination Therapy** (Anti-VEGF + PDT):
- Higher polyp closure rates
- Consider for large polyps
- May be first-line in some populations

**PDT Monotherapy**:
- Less commonly used now
- May be considered in specific situations

---

## General Treatment Principles

### Treat-and-Extend Protocol Framework

**Extension Criteria**:
- No fluid (or acceptable minimal SRF per protocol)
- Stable/improved VA
- No new hemorrhage

**Extension Steps**:
- Typically 2-week increments
- Maximum interval varies by drug (8-16 weeks)

**Shortening Criteria**:
- New or increased fluid
- VA decrease with anatomic correlation
- Return to minimum interval, then re-extend

---

### Treatment Burden Considerations

| Factor | Lower Burden Options |
|--------|---------------------|
| Injection frequency | Longer-acting agents, T&E |
| Monitoring visits | Treat-and-extend (combined) |
| Cost | Bevacizumab (where appropriate) |
| Side effects | Careful agent selection |

---

### When to Consider Switching Agents

- Inadequate response after adequate trial (6+ injections)
- Recurrent fluid despite intensive treatment
- Tolerability issues
- Patient preference

---

## OCT-Guided Treatment Decisions

### Biomarkers Suggesting Treatment Need

| Finding | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| New/increased IRF | Active disease, treat |
| New/increased SRF | Usually treat (some protocols allow minimal SRF) |
| Increased CST | Suggests activity |
| New PED/PED growth | Activity in nAMD |
| HRF increase | Inflammatory activity |

### Biomarkers Suggesting Stability

| Finding | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| Fluid free | May extend interval |
| Stable anatomy | Continue current interval or extend |
| Fibrosis (stable) | May not respond to further treatment |
| Atrophy (stable) | Limited benefit from treatment |
