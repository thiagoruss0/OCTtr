# Security and Privacy Guidelines for OCT Analysis Assistant

## Patient Data Protection

### HIPAA Compliance Considerations

1. **No PHI Storage**: This GPT does not store patient health information between sessions
2. **De-identification**: Users should remove or obscure patient identifiers before sharing OCT images
3. **Session Privacy**: Each conversation is independent; no patient data persists

### Recommended User Practices

- Remove patient name, DOB, and MRN from images before upload
- Use anonymized case identifiers
- Avoid sharing institution-specific patient identifiers
- Do not include full clinical notes with identifying information

## Data Handling

### What This GPT Does:
- Analyzes provided OCT descriptions and findings
- References internal knowledge base for evidence-based responses
- Provides educational and clinical decision support

### What This GPT Does NOT Do:
- Store patient information beyond the current session
- Access external patient databases
- Connect to EHR systems
- Share data with third parties
- Retain uploaded images after session ends

## Usage Boundaries

### Appropriate Use:
- Educational biomarker review
- Clinical decision support for interpretation
- Evidence-based guidance review
- Training and case discussion support
- Quality assurance analysis

### Prohibited Use:
- Sole basis for clinical decisions
- Patient-facing communication without physician review
- Medico-legal documentation
- Replacing formal clinical consultation
- Diagnosing patients without clinical examination

## Professional Responsibility

### Clinician Obligations:
1. Verify all AI-generated insights against clinical findings
2. Maintain responsibility for final clinical decisions
3. Document that AI tools were used as supportive resources only
4. Ensure informed consent where required by institution
5. Report any concerning AI outputs to appropriate channels

### Institutional Considerations:
- Verify institutional policy permits AI tool usage
- Ensure appropriate credentialing for AI-assisted analysis
- Maintain audit trails where required
- Follow local medical device regulations

## Liability Disclaimer

This GPT is provided as a **clinical decision support tool** and does not constitute:
- Medical diagnosis
- Treatment prescription
- Standard of care definition
- Replacement for clinical judgment

All outputs should be:
- Verified by qualified clinicians
- Correlated with clinical examination
- Considered alongside full patient history
- Used within scope of professional licensure

## Incident Reporting

If you encounter:
- Potentially harmful recommendations
- Significant errors in biomarker interpretation
- Security or privacy concerns
- System malfunctions affecting patient care

Please:
1. Do not act on potentially erroneous information
2. Document the incident
3. Report through appropriate channels
4. Provide feedback for system improvement
