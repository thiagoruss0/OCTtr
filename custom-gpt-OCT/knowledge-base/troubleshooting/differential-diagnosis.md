# OCT Differential Diagnosis Guide

## Overview

Similar OCT appearances can represent different pathologies with distinct management approaches. This guide helps differentiate between conditions that may appear similar on OCT.

## Cystoid Macular Edema: Differential

### Conditions Presenting with Macular Cysts

| Condition | Key Features | Distinguishing Points |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| DME | HRF, hemorrhage possible, systemic DM | History, hard exudates |
| RVO | Sectoral pattern (BRVO), hemorrhage | Acute onset, fundus findings |
| Irvine-Gass | Post-surgical | Temporal relation to surgery |
| Uveitic CME | Vitritis, inflammation | Clinical signs of uveitis |
| MacTel Type 2 | Temporal parafoveal, ILM draping | NOT true cysts, bilateral |

### MacTel Type 2 vs. True CME

**Critical Distinction** - MacTel does NOT respond to anti-VEGF

| Feature | MacTel Type 2 | True CME |

**Clinical Pearl**: Consider MacTel in "treatment-resistant CME"

## Algorithmic Approach to Common OCT Patterns

### Macular Thickening Algorithm

```
Macular Thickening
├── With Cystic Spaces
│   ├── Center-involved + HRF + DM history → DME
│   ├── Sectoral + hemorrhage → RVO
│   ├── Post-surgical → Irvine-Gass
│   ├── Temporal parafoveal + bilateral + ILM draping → MacTel
│   └── With vitritis → Uveitic CME
└── Without Cysts (diffuse)
    ├── With ERM → ERM-related thickening
    ├── With VMT → VMT-related thickening
    └── Diffuse + diabetic → Early DME
```

---

### Subretinal Fluid Algorithm

```
Subretinal Fluid
├── With Thick Choroid (>300µm)
│   ├── No drusen, dome SRF → CSC
│   ├── With PED + Type 1 MNV → PNV
│   └── With polyps → PCV
├── With Normal/Thin Choroid
│   ├── With drusen/PED → nAMD
│   └── With inflammation → Inflammatory
└── Multifocal/Bilateral
    ├── With uveal thickening → VKH
    └── With scleritis signs → Posterior scleritis
