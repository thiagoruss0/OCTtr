# OCT Artifacts and Interpretation Pitfalls

## Overview

OCT artifacts are common, occurring in up to 20% of RNFL scans and nearly 30% of macular scans. Recognizing artifacts prevents misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment decisions.

---

## Categories of OCT Artifacts

### 1. Acquisition Artifacts
- Motion artifacts
- Blink artifacts
- Decentration artifacts

### 2. Processing Artifacts
- Segmentation errors
- Mirror artifacts
- Out-of-range artifacts

### 3. Patient-Related Factors
- Media opacities
- Ocular surface disease
- Anatomical variants

---

## Common Artifacts: Detailed Guide

### Motion Artifacts

**Appearance**:
- Horizontal displacement of image
- "Jumping" or shifted retinal image
- Discontinuity in blood vessels
- Wavy or irregular retinal surface

**Causes**:
- Eye movement during acquisition
- Poor fixation
- Nystagmus
- Patient inattention

**Impact**:
- Inaccurate thickness measurements
- Missed pathology
- False interpretation of retinal distortion

**Solutions**:
- Use eye tracking if available
- Ensure proper fixation
- Repeat scan
- Review multiple B-scans

---

### Blink Artifacts

**Appearance**:
- Black horizontal band across image
- Complete data loss in affected area
- May involve central scan area

**Impact**:
- Missing data in critical areas
- Inaccurate volume/thickness calculations
- Potential missed pathology

**Solutions**:
- Instruct patient to blink between scans
- Use artificial tears before scanning
- Repeat affected scans

---

### Decentration Artifacts

**Appearance**:
- Fovea not centered in scan
- Asymmetric thickness map
- Foveal pit displaced from center

**Causes**:
- Poor fixation (eccentric)
- Incorrect scan positioning
- Macular pathology causing eccentric fixation

**Impact**:
- Incorrect CST measurement
- Asymmetric ETDRS values
- Misleading progression analysis

**Identification**:
- Check that foveal pit is centered
- Review B-scans for proper positioning
- Compare to fundus photo alignment

**Solutions**:
- Reposition patient/scan
- Use follow-up mode for consistency
- Document eccentric fixation if unavoidable

---

### Segmentation Errors

**Appearance**:
- Colored segmentation lines in wrong position
- Lines not following retinal boundaries
- Abrupt jumps in segmentation

**Common Sites**:
- ILM (especially with ERM, vitreous opacities)
- RPE (with PED, drusen, atrophy)
- RNFL boundaries

**Causes**:
- Low signal strength
- Pathology confusing algorithm
- Shadow artifacts
- Vitreous opacities

**Impact**:
- Incorrect thickness measurements
- False progression/improvement
- Misinterpretation of pathology extent

**Solutions**:
- Review raw images alongside measurements
- Manual segmentation correction (if available)
- Repeat scan with better quality
- Document known segmentation issues

---

### Low Signal Quality Artifacts

**Causes**:
- Cataract
- Corneal opacity
- Dry eye/poor tear film
- Vitreous opacity
- Small pupil

**Appearance**:
- Grainy, noisy image
- Poor layer definition
- Reduced contrast
- Overall dim image

**Impact**:
- Artifactually thin measurements (especially RNFL)
- Missed subtle pathology
- Unreliable progression analysis

**Management**:
- Note quality metrics in report
- Artificial tears before scanning
- Pupil dilation when needed
- Address reversible factors (dry eye, cataract)
- Repeat on better day if possible

---

### Shadow Artifacts

**Causes**:
- Vitreous floaters
- Blood vessels (normal)
- Hemorrhage
- Opacities

**Appearance**:
- Vertical dark bands
- Obscured retinal layers beneath
- May mimic pathology

**Key Point**: Shadow from blood vessels is normal and expected

**Distinguishing Pathology**:
- Pathological shadows are usually irregular
- Don't follow vessel patterns
- May be denser than normal vessel shadows

---

### Mirror Artifacts

**Appearance**:
- Image appears "folded" or duplicated
- Retinal structures appear both above and below

**Cause**:
- Image wrap-around when retina at edge of scanning window

**Solution**:
- Reposition scan window
- Adjust reference position

---

### Out-of-Range Artifacts

**Appearance**:
- Retinal image cut off at top or bottom
- Incomplete layer visualization

**Cause**:
- Retina extends beyond scan window
- Common in high myopia, staphyloma, large PED

**Solution**:
- Adjust scan window position
- Use enhanced depth imaging (EDI) for choroid

---

## Anatomical Variants Mimicking Pathology

### Peripapillary Atrophy
- Can affect RNFL measurements
- May cause apparent thinning

### High Myopia
- Tilted disc
- Altered normative comparisons
- Thin choroid

### Large Optic Disc
- Affects RNFL distribution
- Normative database may not apply

### Prominent Henle Fiber Layer
- Can appear thickened at fovea
- Varies with scan angle

---

## Disease-Related Interpretation Pitfalls

### "Red Disease" (False Positive)

**Definition**: OCT indicates abnormality (red on normative comparison) when no true pathology exists

**Common Causes**:
- High myopia with tilted disc
- Large disc
- Anatomical variants
- Young patients (thicker normal RNFL)
- Segmentation errors

**Prevention**:
- Correlate with clinical exam
- Consider anatomical factors
- Don't rely solely on color-coded maps

---

### "Green Disease" (False Negative)

**Definition**: OCT shows normal (green) when pathology exists

**Common Causes**:
- Early disease within normal range
- Localized defect averaged out
- Superior/inferior asymmetry not captured
- Segmentation errors masking thinning

**Prevention**:
- Review raw images
- Look for focal defects
- Compare to prior studies
- Clinical correlation essential

---

### Pathology Mimics

**ERM Mimicking Macular Thickening**:
- Mild ERM may not be visible
- Check for surface irregularity
- Review ILM reflectivity

**Vitreous Opacity Mimicking ERM**:
- Floater may appear adherent
- Usually less reflective than true ERM
- May move between scans

**Posterior Vitreous Detachment vs. ERM**:
- PVD: Thin, less reflective
- ERM: More reflective, adherent

## Quality Assurance Checklist

### Before Interpretation

- [ ] Signal strength adequate?
- [ ] Scan properly centered?
- [ ] Motion/blink artifacts present?
- [ ] Segmentation accurate?
- [ ] Media clear or documented opacity?

### During Interpretation

- [ ] Reviewing raw B-scans (not just report)?
- [ ] Correlating with clinical findings?
- [ ] Considering anatomical variants?
- [ ] Comparing to prior studies?
- [ ] Documenting quality issues?

### After Interpretation

- [ ] Findings consistent with exam?
- [ ] Need repeat scan?
- [ ] Document limitations?
- [ ] Flag questionable findings?

## Specific Pitfall Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Apparent Progression That Isn't Real

**Signs of False Progression**:
- Change in signal strength between visits
- Different scan centration
- Segmentation error on one visit
- Dry eye on one visit

**Action**: Compare raw images, check quality metrics

---

### Scenario 2: Flat Thickness Despite Clinical Edema

**Possible Causes**:
- Scan timing (post-treatment)
- Non-central edema
- Subretinal vs. intraretinal fluid
- Segmentation error excluding fluid

**Action**: Review B-scans, correlate with exam

---

### Scenario 3: Unexpected Treatment Response

**If Improvement Without Treatment**:
- Check for segmentation error on baseline
- Verify same eye/patient
- Consider natural disease course

**If No Response to Treatment**:
- Confirm correct diagnosis
- Check for ischemia component
- Review structural factors (DRIL, EZ)
- Consider treatment switch

---

## Summary: Key Principles

1. **Always review raw images** - Don't rely solely on automated reports

2. **Check quality metrics** - Low quality = unreliable measurements

3. **Verify segmentation** - Errors are common and impactful

4. **Clinical correlation** - OCT findings must match exam

5. **Consider artifacts first** - Before diagnosing new pathology

6. **Document limitations** - Note quality issues in reports

7. **Serial comparison** - Single scan findings are less reliable

8. **Multiple tests** - Never diagnose on single test alone
