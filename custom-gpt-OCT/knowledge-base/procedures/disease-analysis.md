# Disease-Specific OCT Analysis Workflows

## General Analysis Framework

Before disease-specific analysis, always perform:

### Step 1: Quality Assessment
1. Check signal strength (>6 Cirrus, >15 Spectralis)
2. Verify foveal centration
3. Assess for motion/blink artifacts
4. Confirm proper segmentation
5. Review for shadowing artifacts

### Step 2: Systematic Scan Review
1. Review all B-scans, not just representative images
2. Assess both horizontal and vertical scans
3. Correlate with thickness maps
4. Compare to prior studies when available
5. Evaluate both eyes

### Step 3: Biomarker Documentation
1. List all identified biomarkers
2. Quantify when possible (thickness, extent)
3. Note location relative to fovea
4. Grade severity
5. Compare to baseline/prior visits

## Diabetic Retinopathy and DME

*Full protocol: `diabetic-disease.md`*

### Key OCT Findings

**Structural Changes**:
- Macular edema (center-involved vs. non-center-involved)
- DRIL assessment in central 1mm
- EZ/ELM integrity
- Epiretinal membrane presence
- Vitreomacular interface abnormalities

**Biomarkers to Document**:
| Biomarker | Measurement | Significance |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| CST | µm | Disease activity |
| DRIL extent | µm or % | VA prognosis |
| HRF count/presence | Yes/No, quantity | Inflammation, activity |
| SRF | Present/Absent | Less common in DME |
| EZ status | Intact/Disrupted/Absent | Visual potential |
| ELM status | Intact/Disrupted/Absent | Recovery potential |
| INL cysts | Present/Absent | Poorer prognosis |

### Prognostic Algorithm
1. DRIL >500µm → Poor VA prognosis regardless of treatment
2. Intact EZ/ELM → Better visual potential
3. INL cysts at baseline → Reduced treatment response
4. Persistent HRF → Ongoing disease activity

## Age-Related Macular Degeneration

*Full protocol: `amd-analysis.md`*

### Dry AMD Assessment

**Staging Features**:
- Drusen size and distribution
- RPD/SDD presence
- IHRF (intraretinal hyperreflective foci)
- Outer retinal band integrity
- Geographic atrophy (if present)

**High-Risk Biomarkers for Progression**:
| Biomarker | Risk Level | OR for Late AMD |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| ELM abnormality | Very High | 15.42 |
| EZ abnormality | Very High | 10.8 |
| IZ abnormality | High | 7.68 |
| Large drusen + RPD | High | HR 6.73 |
| Hyporeflective drusen cores | High | Significant |
| IHRF | High | Significant |

### nAMD Assessment

**MNV Classification**:
- Type 1: Sub-RPE (fibrovascular PED, double-layer sign)
- Type 2: Subretinal (hyperreflective above RPE)
- Type 3: Intraretinal (associated PED, IRF)

**Activity Markers**:
- New or increased SRF
- New or increased IRF
- PED changes
- New hemorrhage
- Increased retinal thickness

**Prognostic Factors**:
- IRF: Negative (associated with worse VA, fibrosis risk)
- SRF: Relatively better prognosis
- HRF persistence: Poor treatment response indicator

## Retinal Vascular Occlusions

*Full protocol: `vascular-occlusions.md`*

### Assessment Protocol

**Structural Evaluation**:
1. Macular edema extent and pattern
2. Hemorrhage location and density
3. DRIL in affected zone
4. EZ/ELM integrity
5. Cotton wool spots (RNFL infarcts)

**OCTA Correlation**:
- FAZ size and regularity
- Capillary nonperfusion areas
- Collateral vessels
- Differentiate ischemic vs. non-ischemic

### Prognostic Biomarkers

| Finding | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Intact ELM | Better VA at 6 months |
| Intact EZ | Better VA at 12 months |
| DRIL in central mm | Reduced VA potential |
| Large FAZ | Poorer prognosis |
| Extensive nonperfusion | Ischemic type, neovascularization risk |

### Distinguish Types

**CRVO vs. BRVO**:
- CRVO: Diffuse involvement, four quadrants
- BRVO: Sectoral, follows venous distribution

## Macular Telangiectasia Type 2

*Full protocol: `mactel-analysis.md`*

### Diagnostic Criteria (OCT)

**Characteristic Findings**:
1. Temporal parafoveal hyporeflective cavities (NOT cystoid edema)
2. ILM draping with preserved foveal contour
3. Loss of normal foveal profile
4. Outer retinal atrophy temporal to fovea
5. EZ disruption in affected areas

**Distinguishing from CME**:
| Feature | MacTel | CME |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Cavity location | Temporal parafoveal | Variable |
| Foveal contour | Preserved | Often altered |
| Exudation | Minimal/absent | Often present |
| ILM | Draped over cavities | Stretched |
| Response to anti-VEGF | None | Usually responds |

### Staging

- Stage 1: Early temporal parafoveal changes
- Stage 2: ILM draping, outer retinal changes
- Stage 3: Right-angled vessels, RPE hyperplasia
- Stage 4: Subretinal neovascularization

### Critical Point
MacTel does NOT respond to anti-VEGF or steroids (unless complicated by SRNV). Misdiagnosis leads to inappropriate treatment.

## Pachychoroid Spectrum Diseases

*Full protocol: `pachychoroid.md`*

### Spectrum Entities
1. Pachychoroid pigment epitheliopathy (PPE)
2. Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC)
3. Pachychoroid neovasculopathy (PNV)
4. Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV)
5. Peripapillary pachychoroid syndrome
6. Focal choroidal excavation

### Key OCT Features

**Choroidal Findings** (requires EDI or SS-OCT):
- SFCT >300-350µm
- Pachyvessels (dilated Haller's layer)
- Choriocapillaris attenuation over pachyvessels
- Focal extrafoveal thickening (>50µm above SFCT)

**RPE/Retinal Findings**:
- PED (various types)
- SRF (dome-shaped in acute CSC)
- RPE irregularity
- Outer retinal changes in chronic disease

### CSC Differentiation

| Feature | Acute CSC | Chronic CSC |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Duration | <4-6 months | >4-6 months |
| SRF | Dome-shaped | May be shallow/irregular |
| Subretinal deposits | Absent | Present |
| Photoreceptors | Usually preserved | Often damaged |
| Prognosis | Usually resolves | Variable, may need treatment |

## Glaucoma

*Full protocol: `glaucoma-optic-nerve.md`*

### Key OCT Measurements

**RNFL (Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer)**:
- Peripapillary RNFL thickness (average and quadrants)
- RNFL deviation map for focal defects
- ISNT rule assessment (Inferior > Superior > Nasal > Temporal)

**Ganglion Cell Complex (GCC)**:
- Combined RNFL + GCL + IPL thickness
- Macular region analysis
- GLV (Global Loss Volume) and FLV (Focal Loss Volume)

**Optic Nerve Head**:
- Cup-to-disc ratio
- Rim area
- Disc area

### Staging Approach

| Stage | RNFL Status | Monitoring |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Preperimetric | >83µm, focal defects possible | OCT primary |
| Early-Moderate | 55-83µm | OCT + VF |
| Advanced | <55µm (floor effect) | VF primary |

### Progression Detection
- Normal aging: -0.5 to -0.6 µm/year
- Glaucomatous: -1 to -2 µm/year or faster
- Event-based and trend-based analysis

### Key Pitfalls
- "Green disease": normal color-coding despite early glaucoma
- "Red disease": abnormal color-coding due to myopia/variants
- Always review deviation maps and raw images

## Optic Nerve Diseases

*Full protocol: `glaucoma-optic-nerve.md`*

### Papilledema vs. Pseudopapilledema

| Feature | Papilledema | ODD (Pseudopapilledema) |
|---------|-------------|-------------------------|
| RNFL | Elevated all quadrants | Normal or mild elevation |
| RPE/BM angle | Inward deflection | Flat |
| Peripapillary wrinkles | Present | Absent |
| Drusen on EDI-OCT | Absent | Visible |

### Optic Neuritis
- Acute: Variable RNFL (normal to swollen)
- Chronic: Temporal RNFL thinning
- Novel biomarker: Retrolaminar hyperreflective foci (EDI-OCT)

### NAION
- Acute: Sectoral disc swelling, RNFL elevation
- Chronic: Altitudinal RNFL thinning
- RPE/BM angle typically flat (vs. papilledema)

### Pattern Recognition

| RNFL Pattern | Suggests |
|--------------|----------|
| Inferior/Superior (arcuate) | Glaucoma |
| Temporal predominant | Optic neuritis, toxic, hereditary |
| Altitudinal | NAION |
| Band (nasal + temporal) | Chiasmal lesion |
