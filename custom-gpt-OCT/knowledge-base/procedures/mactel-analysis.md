# Macular Telangiectasia Type 2: OCT Analysis Protocol

## Overview

Macular Telangiectasia Type 2 (MacTel Type 2) is a bilateral, acquired retinal disease with both neurodegenerative and vasculopathic characteristics. Recognition is crucial as it is frequently misdiagnosed and does NOT respond to anti-VEGF therapy (unless complicated by SRNV).

---

## Disease Characteristics

### Epidemiology
- Typically presents in 5th-6th decade of life
- Bilateral but often asymmetric
- Prevalence: ~0.1% in population >40 years
- Slight male predominance in some studies

### Pathophysiology
- Primarily neurodegenerative disorder involving Müller cells
- Secondary vascular changes
- NOT a primary vascular leakage disorder like DME
- Müller cell dysfunction leads to photoreceptor loss

---

## Classic OCT Findings

### Temporal Parafoveal Cavitations

**Key Characteristics**:
- Hyporeflective spaces temporal to fovea
- Located in inner and outer nuclear layers
- NOT true cysts (no fluid-filled cavities)
- Represent tissue loss/degeneration

**Critical Distinction from CME**:
| Feature | MacTel Cavitations | Cystoid Macular Edema |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Content | Empty/degenerated tissue | Fluid-filled |
| Walls | Absent true walls | Cyst walls visible |
| Location | Temporal parafoveal | Variable |
| Treatment response | None to anti-VEGF | Responds to anti-VEGF |

---

### ILM Draping

**Description**:
- Internal limiting membrane drapes over underlying cavitations
- Creates "diving board" or "draped" appearance
- Foveal contour often preserved despite changes

**Significance**:
- Distinguishes from macular hole
- Indicates tissue loss beneath intact ILM

---

### Foveal Contour

**Key Point**: Often preserved despite significant pathology

**Comparison**:
| MacTel | Macular Hole | CME |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| Usually preserved | Disrupted | Often altered |
| ILM intact, draped | ILM absent centrally | ILM stretched |

---

### Outer Retinal Changes

**EZ Disruption**:
- Typically begins temporal to fovea
- Progressive loss toward center
- Correlates with scotoma development

**ELM Changes**:
- May show discontinuity
- Often parallels EZ loss

**Photoreceptor Loss**:
- Progressive outer retinal atrophy
- Temporal > central initially
- Hyporeflective outer retina

---

### Right-Angled Vessels

**OCT Appearance**:
- Vessels diving at 90° from inner retina toward RPE
- May be visible as hyperreflective dots/lines
- Better seen on OCTA

**Significance**:
- Characteristic of MacTel
- Not seen in typical CME

---

## Staging System

### Stage 1 - Early
- Minimal visible changes
- Loss of retinal transparency on exam
- OCT may show subtle temporal changes
- EZ may be intact

### Stage 2 - Intermediate
- Parafoveal cavitations visible
- ILM draping
- EZ disruption temporal to fovea
- Possible crystalline deposits on fundus

### Stage 3 - Advanced
- More extensive cavitations
- Right-angled vessels prominent
- Significant outer retinal atrophy
- RPE hyperplasia may be present

### Stage 4 - Neovascular
- Subretinal neovascularization (SRNV)
- May have SRF and hemorrhage
- **Only stage that may respond to anti-VEGF**

---

## OCTA Findings

### Vascular Changes
- Temporal parafoveal capillary telangiectasia
- Right-angled vessels
- Deeper capillary plexus abnormalities
- Reduced capillary density

### Utility
- Earlier detection than fundoscopy
- Distinguish from other conditions
- Monitor for SRNV development

---

## Common Misdiagnoses

### Frequently Confused With:

1. **Cystoid Macular Edema**
   - MacTel cavitations mistaken for cysts
   - Leads to unnecessary anti-VEGF treatment

2. **Macular Hole**
   - ILM draping can mimic early hole
   - Full-thickness defect absent in MacTel

3. **Lamellar Hole**
   - Schisis-like changes in MacTel
   - Look for temporal location, bilateral nature

4. **Epiretinal Membrane**
   - ILM draping misinterpreted as ERM
   - MacTel lacks typical ERM wrinkling pattern

5. **Diabetic Macular Edema**
   - Bilateral cystic changes
   - MacTel lacks exudates, hemorrhages

---

## Diagnostic Criteria Summary

### Essential Features
- Bilateral involvement (even if asymmetric)
- Temporal parafoveal location
- Hyporeflective cavitations (not fluid)
- ILM draping with preserved foveal contour
- Absence of significant exudation
- Progressive outer retinal changes

### Supportive Features
- Right-angled vessels (OCT/OCTA)
- Crystalline deposits (fundus)
- Loss of retinal transparency
- RPE hyperplasia (late)
- Age 40-60 years at presentation

---

## Treatment Implications

### What Does NOT Work
- Anti-VEGF injections (no benefit for non-neovascular MacTel)
- Corticosteroid injections
- Laser photocoagulation

### What May Help
- Low vision aids
- Monitoring for SRNV
- Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) - investigational

### When to Treat
- **Only Stage 4 (SRNV)** warrants anti-VEGF
- Signs of SRNV:
  - New subretinal fluid
  - Subretinal hemorrhage
  - Active neovascular membrane on OCTA

---

## Monitoring Protocol

### Frequency
- Every 6-12 months for stable disease
- Patient education on Amsler grid monitoring
- Sooner if symptoms change

### What to Monitor
- Progression of cavitations
- EZ/outer retinal changes
- Development of SRNV
- Visual function (VA, microperimetry)

## Key Differentiating Points

### MacTel vs. DME
| Feature | MacTel | DME |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Laterality | Bilateral | Often unilateral or asymmetric |
| Location | Temporal parafoveal | Central/variable |
| Exudates | Absent | Common |
| Hemorrhage | Rare (unless SRNV) | May be present |
| HRF | Uncommon | Common |
| Anti-VEGF response | None | Usually responds |

### MacTel vs. Macular Hole
| Feature | MacTel | Macular Hole |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| ILM | Draped, intact | Absent centrally (full thickness) |
| Foveal contour | Preserved | Disrupted |
| Location of changes | Temporal parafoveal | Central |
| Bilateral | Yes | Usually unilateral |

---

## Clinical Pearl

**Critical Message**: Recognition of MacTel Type 2 prevents:
- Inappropriate treatment with anti-VEGF
- Unnecessary corticosteroid injections
- Months/years of ineffective therapy
- Patient frustration from non-response

When encountering "treatment-resistant CME," always consider MacTel.
