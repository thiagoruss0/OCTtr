# Diabetic Retinopathy and DME: OCT Analysis Protocol

## Overview

Optical coherence tomography is essential for detecting, classifying, and monitoring diabetic macular edema (DME) and evaluating biomarkers that predict visual outcomes and treatment response.

---

## Classification of Diabetic Macular Edema

### Center-Involved vs. Non-Center-Involved

**Center-Involved DME (CI-DME)**:
- Definition: Retinal thickening involving the central subfield (central 1mm)
- Significance: Primary indication for anti-VEGF treatment
- CST thresholds vary by device:
  - Cirrus: >290µm (females), >305µm (males)
  - Spectralis: >320µm (females), >335µm (males)
  - Heidelberg values tend higher due to segmentation differences

**Non-Center-Involved DME**:
- Thickening outside central subfield
- May be observed or treated with focal laser
- Monitor for progression to CI-DME

---

## Key Biomarkers in DME

### 1. Central Subfield Thickness (CST)

**Measurement**:
- ETDRS central 1mm diameter circle
- Automated segmentation from ILM to RPE

**Clinical Interpretation**:
| CST Change | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| Decrease >10% | Treatment response |
| Stable (±10%) | Consider extension or observation |
| Increase >10% | Disease activity, consider treatment |

**Limitations**:
- CST alone does not predict visual outcomes
- Biomarker assessment more valuable than thickness alone

---

### 2. Disorganization of Retinal Inner Layers (DRIL)

**Definition**: Inability to distinguish GCL-IPL, INL, and OPL boundaries in central 1mm

**Measurement Protocol**:
1. Identify central 1mm zone (500µm each side of fovea)
2. Assess if inner retinal layers are distinguishable
3. Measure extent of disorganization in µm
4. Calculate percentage of central zone affected

**Thresholds**:
- >500µm or >50% of central 1mm = significant
- Associated with ~6 letter worse VA at 12 months

**Prognostic Value**:
| DRIL Status | VA Prognosis |
|-------------|--------------|
| Absent | Better visual potential |
| Present <500µm | Intermediate |
| Present >500µm | Poor, regardless of edema resolution |

**Key Point**: DRIL persists after edema resolution and predicts final VA

---

### 3. Hyperreflective Foci (HRF)

**Identification**:
- Small (20-40µm) hyperreflective dots
- Located within retinal layers
- No posterior shadowing
- Distinct from hard exudates (larger, shadowing)

**Clinical Significance**:
- Marker of inflammation and barrier breakdown
- Associated with worse baseline VA
- Correlates with disease activity
- Resolution indicates treatment response

**Quantification**:
- Present/Absent
- Few (<5) vs. Moderate (5-20) vs. Many (>20)
- Layer location (inner vs. outer retina)

**Prognostic Impact**: ~6.5 ETDRS letters worse VA at 6 months if present

---

### 4. Ellipsoid Zone (EZ) Integrity

**Assessment**:
- Intact: Continuous hyperreflective line through fovea
- Disrupted: Focal discontinuity
- Absent: Loss of line in area of interest

**Clinical Significance**:
- Strong predictor of visual potential
- ~10 letters worse VA if disrupted vs. intact
- May recover if edema resolves early

---

### 5. External Limiting Membrane (ELM) Integrity

**Assessment**: Similar to EZ (intact/disrupted/absent)

**Clinical Significance**:
- Disruption often precedes EZ damage
- Intact ELM with disrupted EZ suggests recovery potential
- Combined ELM + EZ disruption = poor prognosis

---

### 6. Subretinal Fluid (SRF)

**Prevalence**: Less common in DME than IRF

**Significance**:
- May indicate more severe disease
- Consider alternative diagnoses if prominent (CSC, nAMD)
- Generally responds to anti-VEGF therapy

---

### 7. Cyst Location

**Inner Nuclear Layer Cysts (INLc)**:
- Associated with poorer treatment response
- Baseline INLc predicts partial/non-response to ranibizumab
- 26.5% good responders vs. 73.5% partial/non-responders had INLc

**Outer Nuclear Layer Cysts (ONLc)**:
- More common in DME
- May indicate photoreceptor stress

---

### 8. Vitreomacular Interface

**Assessment**:
- Vitreomacular adhesion (VMA)
- Vitreomacular traction (VMT)
- Epiretinal membrane (ERM)

**Significance**:
- VMA at baseline associated with poorer BCVA improvement
- VMT may require surgical consideration
- ERM can complicate DME management

---

## Morphologic Patterns

### Pattern Classification

1. **Diffuse Retinal Thickening (DRT)**
   - Sponge-like appearance
   - Less distinct cystic spaces
   - Often extensive

2. **Cystoid Macular Edema (CME)**
   - Well-defined cystic spaces
   - Often INL and/or ONL involvement
   - Petalloid pattern on en face

3. **Serous Retinal Detachment**
   - Subretinal fluid component
   - Less common in isolation
   - Consider alternative diagnoses

4. **Mixed Pattern**
   - Combination of above
   - Most common presentation

---

## Treatment Response Assessment

### Good Response Indicators
- CST decrease >10% from baseline
- Resolution of SRF
- Reduction in cyst size
- Decrease in HRF
- Stable or improving EZ integrity

### Poor Response Indicators
- Persistent edema after 3-6 injections
- No CST improvement
- Persistent or increasing HRF
- Worsening DRIL
- Progressive EZ disruption

### Treatment Considerations Based on OCT

| Finding | Consideration |
|---------|---------------|
| Good response | Continue, consider extension |
| Partial response | Continue, evaluate switching agents |
| Non-response after 6 doses | Consider switching agent or steroid |
| VMT component | Consider vitrectomy if persistent |
| ERM component | Evaluate surgical intervention |

---

## Monitoring Protocol

### Active Treatment Phase
- Monthly OCT until stable
- Document all biomarkers
- Compare to baseline

### Maintenance/Extension Phase
- Follow treat-and-extend intervals
- Retreat if:
  - CST increase >10%
  - New or increased fluid
  - VA decrease with anatomic correlation

### Resolved DME
- Monitor for recurrence
- Assess for residual structural damage
- DRIL, EZ status predict final VA

## OCTA in Diabetic Eye Disease

### Key Findings
- FAZ enlargement/irregularity
- Capillary nonperfusion
- Microaneurysm detection
- DCP (deep capillary plexus) abnormalities

### Clinical Utility
- DCP changes may predict DME development
- Quantify ischemic burden
- Complement structural OCT

## Documentation Checklist

For each DME assessment, document:

- [ ] CST measurement
- [ ] CI-DME vs. non-CI-DME
- [ ] DRIL (present/absent, extent if present)
- [ ] IRF (location, extent)
- [ ] SRF (present/absent)
- [ ] HRF (present/absent, quantity)
- [ ] EZ integrity (intact/disrupted/absent)
- [ ] ELM integrity (intact/disrupted/absent)
- [ ] VMI status (normal, VMA, VMT, ERM)
- [ ] Comparison to prior (if available)

## Prognosis Summary

- Absence of HRF
- No INL cysts
- Good early treatment response

### Unfavorable Factors
- DRIL >500µm in central mm
- Disrupted EZ and ELM
- Abundant HRF
- INL cyst predominance
