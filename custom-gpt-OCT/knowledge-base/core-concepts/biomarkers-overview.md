# OCT Biomarkers: Comprehensive Reference Guide

## Overview

OCT biomarkers are structural or morphological findings that provide diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic guidance in retinal diseases. This document catalogs key biomarkers with clinical significance.

---

## Fluid Biomarkers

### Intraretinal Fluid (IRF)

**Definition**: Hyporeflective spaces within retinal layers, typically appearing as cysts

**Subtypes**:
- **Outer nuclear layer cysts (ONLc)**: Located in ONL
- **Inner nuclear layer cysts (INLc)**: Located in INL; associated with poorer DME prognosis
- **Diffuse retinal thickening**: Non-cystic fluid accumulation

**Clinical Significance**:
| Disease | Prognostic Value |
|---------|------------------|
| DME | Disease activity marker |
| nAMD | Negative prognostic factor; associated with worse VA |
| RVO | Activity indicator |
| MacTel | Absent; hyporeflective spaces are cavitations, not fluid |

**Treatment Response**: Resolution indicates therapeutic efficacy

---

### Subretinal Fluid (SRF)

**Definition**: Hyporeflective space between neurosensory retina and RPE

**Morphology**:
- Dome-shaped (CSC)
- Irregular (nAMD)
- Loculated

**Clinical Significance**:
| Disease | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| nAMD | Better prognosis than IRF; some studies show protective effect |
| DME | Less common; may indicate severe disease |
| CSC | Defining feature; resolves spontaneously in acute cases |
| RVO | Activity marker |

**Note**: Fluid location (IRF vs. SRF) often more prognostically important than central thickness alone

---

### Sub-RPE Fluid

**Definition**: Fluid accumulation beneath RPE, forming pigment epithelial detachment (PED)

**PED Types**:
1. **Serous PED**: Homogeneous hyporeflective content
2. **Fibrovascular PED**: Heterogeneous hyperreflective material (suggests MNV)
3. **Drusenoid PED**: Drusen material elevation
4. **Hemorrhagic PED**: Hyperreflective dome with shadowing

---

## Structural Biomarkers

### Disorganization of Retinal Inner Layers (DRIL)

**Definition**: Inability to distinguish boundaries between GCL-IPL complex, INL, and OPL

**Measurement**: Central 1mm (1000µm diameter from foveal center)

**Threshold**: >50% or >500µm considered significant

**Clinical Significance**:
- Strong predictor of visual outcomes in DME
- Associated with worse VA even after edema resolution
- Indicates neuronal damage beyond reversible edema
- Relevant in RVO prognosis

**Grading**:
- Present/Absent
- Extent in µm or percentage of central zone

---

### Ellipsoid Zone (EZ) Integrity

**Definition**: Continuity of the EZ band (formerly IS/OS junction)

**Assessment**:
- Intact: Continuous hyperreflective line
- Disrupted: Focal loss or discontinuity
- Absent: Complete loss in region

**Clinical Significance**:
| Disease | Prognostic Value |
|---------|------------------|
| DME | Strong predictor of visual outcome |
| nAMD | Correlates with visual potential |
| RVO | Predicts VA at 12 months |
| MacTel | Progressive loss temporal to fovea |
| CSC | Recovery indicates good prognosis |

---

### External Limiting Membrane (ELM) Integrity

**Definition**: Continuity of ELM band

**Clinical Significance**:
- ELM disruption often precedes EZ disruption
- Intact ELM with disrupted EZ may indicate recovery potential
- Complete loss of both = poor visual prognosis

**Assessment**: Similar grading to EZ (intact/disrupted/absent)

---

### Hyperreflective Foci (HRF)

**Definition**: Small, punctate hyperreflective lesions within retinal layers

**Characteristics**:
- Size typically 20-40µm
- No shadowing (distinguishes from hemorrhage)
- May be located in any retinal layer

**Proposed Origins**:
1. Migrating RPE cells
2. Lipid-laden macrophages
3. Activated microglia
4. Extravasated lipoproteins (hard exudate precursors)
5. Degenerating photoreceptors

**Clinical Significance**:
| Disease | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| DME | Disease activity; correlate with inflammation; associated with worse VA |
| nAMD | Persistent HRF in non-responders; reduction indicates treatment response |
| Dry AMD | IHRF (Intraretinal HRF) predicts progression to late AMD |
| RVO | Inflammatory marker |

---

### Intraretinal Hyperreflective Foci (IHRF) - AMD Specific

**Definition**: HRF specifically overlying drusen in AMD

**Significance**:
- High-risk marker for progression to late AMD (GA or nAMD)
- OR 15.42 for progression to late AMD
- Represents migrated RPE cells
- Part of nascent geographic atrophy definition

---

## Choroidal Biomarkers

### Subfoveal Choroidal Thickness (SFCT)

**Definition**: Distance from outer RPE to choroid-scleral interface at fovea

**Normal Range**: 190-350µm (varies with age, axial length)

**Thresholds**:
- >300µm: Consider pachychoroid
- >350-395µm: Likely pachychoroid
- >389µm: Machine learning derived pachychoroid cutoff

**Clinical Significance**:
| Condition | SFCT Finding |
|-----------|--------------|
| CSC | Increased (pachychoroid) |
| High myopia | Decreased |
| AMD (dry) | Variable, often decreased |
| nAMD | May be normal or increased |

---

### Choroidal Vascularity Index (CVI)

**Definition**: Ratio of choroidal vascular luminal area to total choroidal area

**Significance**:
- Lower CVI may indicate choroidal vascular dysfunction
- Useful in pachychoroid spectrum diseases
- Research tool becoming more clinically applicable

---

### Pachyvessels

**Definition**: Dilated outer choroidal (Haller's layer) vessels

**Significance**:
- Diagnostic feature of pachychoroid spectrum
- May be present even with normal overall choroidal thickness
- Associated choriocapillaris attenuation

---

## AMD-Specific Biomarkers

### Drusen Characteristics

**Types**:
- Small drusen: <63µm
- Intermediate drusen: 63-125µm
- Large drusen: >125µm
- Soft drusen: Indistinct borders, higher risk
- Reticular pseudodrusen (RPD)/Subretinal drusenoid deposits (SDD): Located above RPE

**Risk Markers**:
- Hyporeflective drusen cores: Associated with progression
- Large drusen + RPD: HR 6.73 for late AMD

---

### Reticular Pseudodrusen (RPD)/Subretinal Drusenoid Deposits (SDD)

**Definition**: Hyperreflective deposits between RPE and EZ

**Significance**:
- Higher risk of progression to GA than soft drusen
- Associated with AMD progression
- Best visualized on infrared or en face OCT

---

### Pigment Epithelial Detachment (PED) - AMD

**Double-Layer Sign**: Hyperreflective line within/beneath PED suggesting Type 1 MNV

**Significance by Type**:
- Serous: May indicate active CNV or CSC
- Fibrovascular: Type 1 MNV
- Drusenoid: AMD progression risk

---

## Neovascularization Biomarkers

### MNV Type Classification (OCT)

**Type 1 (Sub-RPE)**:
- Fibrovascular PED
- Double-layer sign
- Best seen on OCTA

**Type 2 (Subretinal)**:
- Hyperreflective material above RPE
- Associated SRF
- "Mushroom" configuration if both sub-RPE and subretinal

**Type 3 (Intraretinal/RAP)**:
- Originates in retina, extends to RPE
- Associated with PED, often serous
- High-risk for fellow eye involvement
- Characteristic IRF pattern

---

## Glaucoma and Optic Nerve Biomarkers

### Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) Thickness

**Definition**: Thickness of the nerve fiber layer, typically measured peripapillary

**Measurement**:
- Circular scan around optic disc (3.4mm diameter)
- Reported as average and by quadrant/sector

**Normal Pattern (ISNT Rule)**:
- Inferior > Superior > Nasal > Temporal
- Violation suggests glaucoma

**Reference Values**:
| Status | Average RNFL | Clinical Meaning |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| Normal | Within green zone (>5th percentile) | Normal range |
| Borderline | Yellow zone (1st-5th percentile) | Suspect |
| Abnormal | Red zone (<1st percentile) | Below normal |
| Floor effect | <50-55µm | Progression monitoring limited |

**Age-Related Changes**:
- Normal loss: ~0.5-0.6 µm/year
- Glaucomatous loss: ~1-2 µm/year or faster

---

### Ganglion Cell Complex (GCC)

**Definition**: Combined thickness of RNFL + GCL + IPL

**Location**: Macular region (contains >50% of all ganglion cells)

**Key Parameters**:
| Parameter | Description | Utility |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Average GCC | Mean thickness | Overall assessment |
| Superior/Inferior GCC | Hemifield analysis | Corresponds to VF |
| GLV (Global Loss Volume) | % abnormal pixels | Best for early glaucoma |
| FLV (Focal Loss Volume) | Focally thin areas | Localized damage |

**Clinical Significance**:
- May detect early glaucoma before RNFL changes
- Complementary to peripapillary RNFL
- GLV: OR 1.74 for preperimetric glaucoma
- FLV: OR 2.32 for advanced glaucoma

---

### Optic Nerve Head Parameters

**Cup-to-Disc Ratio (C/D)**:
- Increased in glaucoma
- Vertical C/D most significant
- Asymmetry between eyes suspicious

**Rim Area**:

**Distinguishing from Papilledema**:
| Feature | ODD | Papilledema |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| RNFL | Normal or mild elevation | Markedly elevated |
| RPE/BM angle | Flat | Inward deflection |
| Peripapillary wrinkles | Absent | Present |
| Internal contour | "Lumpy-bumpy" | Smooth |

---

### Papilledema Biomarkers

**Acute Papilledema**:
- RNFL elevation (especially nasal)
- Positive RPE/BM angle (67% of cases)
- Peripapillary wrinkles on en face OCT
- Total retinal thickness increased over disc
