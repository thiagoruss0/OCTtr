# Glaucoma and Optic Nerve Diseases: OCT Analysis Protocol

---

# PART 1: GLAUCOMA

## Overview

OCT is essential for glaucoma diagnosis, staging, and progression monitoring. Structural damage (RNFL thinning) often precedes visual field defects by approximately 6 years.

---

## Key OCT Measurements in Glaucoma

### 1. Peripapillary RNFL (Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer)

**Definition**: Thickness of the nerve fiber layer around the optic disc

**Measurement Protocol**:
- Circular scan centered on optic disc (3.4mm diameter)
- Divided into clock hours, quadrants, and sectors

**Normal Pattern (ISNT Rule)**:
- **I**nferior > **S**uperior > **N**asal > **T**emporal
- Violation suggests glaucoma

**Thickness Interpretation**:
| RNFL Status | Values | Clinical Meaning |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| Normal | >95th percentile (green) | Within normal limits |
| Borderline | 5th-95th percentile (yellow) | Suspect |
| Abnormal | <5th percentile (red) | Below normal |
| Floor effect | <50-55µm | Progression monitoring limited |

**Age-Related Thinning**:
- Normal: ~0.5-0.6 µm/year
- Glaucomatous: ~1-2 µm/year or faster

---

### 2. Ganglion Cell Complex (GCC)

**Definition**: Combined thickness of RNFL + GCL + IPL

**Clinical Importance**:
- Macula contains >50% of all retinal ganglion cells
- May detect early glaucoma before RNFL changes
- Complementary to peripapillary RNFL

**Key Parameters**:
| Parameter | Description | Significance |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Average GCC | Mean thickness | Overall assessment |
| Superior/Inferior GCC | Hemifield analysis | Corresponds to VF |
| GLV (Global Loss Volume) | % abnormal pixels | Best for early glaucoma (OR: 1.74) |
| FLV (Focal Loss Volume) | Focally thin areas | Better for advanced (OR: 2.32) |

---

### 3. Optic Nerve Head (ONH) Analysis

| Parameter | Glaucomatous Change |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Rim area | Decreased |
| Cup-to-disc ratio | Increased |
| Cup volume | Increased |
| RNFL symmetry | Asymmetry suspicious |

---

## Glaucoma Staging

### Practical Staging Approach

| Stage | RNFL | VF MD | Monitoring |
|-------|------|-------|------------|
| Preperimetric/Early | >83µm | >-2.5 dB | OCT primary |
| Moderate | 55-83µm | -2.5 to -10 dB | OCT + VF |
| Advanced | <55µm | <-10 dB | VF primary (floor effect) |

### Progression Rates
| Category | RNFL Loss Rate | Action |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| Normal aging | -0.5 to -0.6 µm/year | Expected |
| Slow progression | -0.6 to -1.0 µm/year | Monitor |
| Moderate | -1.0 to -2.0 µm/year | Treatment adjustment |
| Rapid | >-2.0 µm/year | Urgent intervention |

---

## Pattern Recognition

### Typical Glaucomatous Patterns
- **Localized Wedge**: Focal RNFL thinning (inferior/superior temporal)
- **Diffuse Thinning**: Generalized RNFL loss
- **Asymmetric Damage**: >20% inter-eye difference

### RNFL Deviation Map
- Yellow pixels: borderline thin
- Red pixels: abnormally thin
- Wedge-shaped red clusters: glaucomatous
- **Always review deviation maps**, not just summary numbers

---

## "Green Disease" and "Red Disease"

### Green Disease (False Negative)
OCT shows normal despite true glaucoma
- Causes: Early disease, large disc, focal defect averaged out, high myopia
- Prevention: Review deviation maps, combine with GCC, clinical correlation

### Red Disease (False Positive)
OCT shows abnormal without true disease
- Causes: High myopia, tilted disc, peripapillary atrophy, variants
- Prevention: Clinical correlation, review raw images, repeat scans

---

## Structure-Function Correlation

| RNFL Region | Corresponding VF Area |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Superior | Inferior VF (especially nasal) |
| Inferior | Superior VF (especially nasal) |
| Temporal | Central VF |
| Nasal | Peripheral temporal VF |

---

## Quality Assessment

| Parameter | Cirrus | Spectralis |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Signal strength | >6 | >15 |
| Centration | On disc | On disc |
| Segmentation | Accurate | Accurate |

---

# PART 2: OPTIC NERVE DISEASES

## Optic Disc Edema vs. Pseudopapilledema

### Critical Differentiation

| Feature | True Papilledema | Pseudopapilledema (ODD) |
|---------|------------------|------------------------|
| RNFL thickness | Increased (all quadrants) | Normal or mild |
| Nasal RNFL | Significantly elevated | Less elevated |
| Internal contour | Smooth | "Lumpy-bumpy" |
| Peripapillary wrinkles | Present | Absent |
| RPE/BM angle | Inward deflection (67%) | Flat |
| Drusen on EDI-OCT | Absent | Visible |

---

## Optic Disc Drusen (ODD)

### OCT Diagnostic Criteria
Signal-poor lesion in prelaminar region with:
- Hyperreflective cap, OR
- Multiple small hyperreflective aggregates within signal-poor core

### EDI-OCT Findings
- Hyporeflective core with hyperreflective margin/cap
- 100% detection with EDI-OCT (vs. 41% ultrasound)
- May have associated RNFL thinning (chronic)
- Can coexist with glaucoma

---

## Papilledema

### OCT Characteristics
| Finding | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| RNFL | Markedly elevated (all quadrants) |
| Nasal RNFL | Particularly elevated |
| RPE/BM angle | Inward deflection (67%) |
| Peripapillary wrinkles | Present on en face |
| Subretinal fluid | May be present |

### Monitoring Resolution
- Nasal cpRNFL resolves fastest
- Serial OCT tracks treatment response

---

## Optic Neuritis

### Acute Phase
- RNFL: Variable (normal to swollen)
- Novel biomarker: Retrolaminar hyperreflective foci (EDI-OCT)

### Chronic Phase
| Finding | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| RNFL | Temporal thinning (characteristic) |
| GCC | Reduced thickness |
| Pattern | Papillomacular bundle affected |

### MS vs. Isolated ON
| Parameter | MS-Associated | Isolated |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| RNFL loss | Often more severe | Variable |
| Fellow eye | May show subclinical loss | Normal |
| INL microcysts | Associated with activity | Less common |

### NMOSD
- More severe RNFL loss than MS
- Often bilateral
- Associated with AQP4/MOG antibodies

---

## NAION (Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy)

### Acute Phase
- RNFL elevated (sectoral, often altitudinal)
- RPE/BM angle usually flat (vs. papilledema)

### Chronic Phase (6+ weeks)
- Altitudinal RNFL thinning
- Corresponds to VF defect

### NAION vs. Optic Neuritis
| Feature | NAION | Optic Neuritis |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| Age | >50 | 20-45 |
| Pain | Minimal | Pain with movement |
| RNFL pattern | Altitudinal | Temporal |
| Recovery | Limited | Often good |

---

## Other Optic Neuropathies

### Compressive Optic Neuropathy
- RNFL/GCC thinning (pattern depends on lesion)
- **Band atrophy** (chiasmal): Nasal + temporal loss, "bow-tie" pattern

### Hereditary (LHON, DOA)
- Temporal RNFL thinning
- Papillomacular bundle loss
- Often bilateral, symmetric

### Toxic/Nutritional
- Temporal RNFL thinning
- Bilateral, symmetric
- Causes: Ethambutol, B12 deficiency, methanol

---

## RNFL Pattern Differential Diagnosis

| Pattern | Primary Consideration |
|---------|----------------------|
| Inferior/Superior (arcuate) | **Glaucoma** |
| Temporal predominant | Optic neuritis, hereditary, toxic |
| Altitudinal | **NAION** |
| Diffuse | Advanced glaucoma, compression |
| Band (nasal + temporal) | **Chiasmal lesion** |
| Elevated all quadrants | **Papilledema** |

## Key Clinical Pearls

1. **ISNT rule violation** → suspect glaucoma
2. **Temporal RNFL loss** → think optic neuritis, NOT glaucoma
3. **Altitudinal pattern** → classic for NAION
4. **RPE/BM inward deflection** → papilledema (67%)
5. **EDI-OCT** is essential for optic disc drusen
6. **Floor effect (<55µm)** limits OCT utility in advanced glaucoma
7. **Nasal RNFL** resolves fastest in papilledema
8. **Fellow eye comparison** critical in unilateral presentations
9. **Deviation maps** catch focal defects missed by averages
10. **Band atrophy** (nasal + temporal) → chiasmal lesion
