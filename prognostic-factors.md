# OCT Prognostic Factors: Comprehensive Guide

## Overview

This guide consolidates evidence-based OCT biomarkers that predict visual outcomes and treatment response across major macular diseases. Understanding these factors enables better patient counseling and treatment optimization.

---

## Universal Prognostic Biomarkers

### Outer Retinal Band Integrity

**Ellipsoid Zone (EZ)**

| Status | Prognostic Implication |
|--------|----------------------|
| Intact | Better visual potential; correlates with preserved photoreceptor function |
| Disrupted | Reduced VA recovery potential; approximately 10 letters worse outcome |
| Absent | Poor visual prognosis; indicates photoreceptor loss |

**Evidence Strength**: High across multiple diseases (DME, RVO, nAMD)

---

**External Limiting Membrane (ELM)**

| Status | Prognostic Implication |
|--------|----------------------|
| Intact | Positive prognostic indicator; recovery possible |
| Disrupted | Intermediate prognosis; may recover if EZ intact |
| Absent | Poor prognosis; Müller cell-photoreceptor junction damaged |

**Note**: ELM disruption often precedes EZ loss; intact ELM with disrupted EZ may indicate recovery potential

---

### Disorganization of Retinal Inner Layers (DRIL)

| Extent | Prognostic Implication |
|--------|----------------------|
| Absent | Better visual outcome potential |
| <500µm (central 1mm) | Intermediate prognosis |
| >500µm (central 1mm) | Poor visual outcome; ~6 letters worse at 12 months |

**Key Points**:
- Persists after edema resolution
- Predicts final VA regardless of treatment
- Applicable to DME and RVO

---

### Hyperreflective Foci (HRF)

| Status | Prognostic Implication |
|--------|----------------------|
| Absent | More favorable prognosis |
| Present | Disease activity marker; ~6.5 letters worse VA at 6 months |
| Persistent after treatment | Poor responder indicator |

**Disease-Specific Significance**:
- DME: Inflammatory marker, activity indicator
- nAMD: Non-responder marker if persistent
- Dry AMD: IHRF predicts progression to late AMD

## Diabetic Macular Edema: Prognostic Summary

### Positive Prognostic Factors

| Factor | Impact | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Intact EZ | Better final VA | Strong |
| Intact ELM | Better recovery | Strong |
| Absent DRIL | Better outcome | Strong |
| Absent HRF | Less inflammation | Moderate |
| No INL cysts | Better treatment response | Moderate |
| Normal VMI | Better treatment response | Moderate |
| Early treatment response | Predicts final outcome | Strong |

### Negative Prognostic Factors

| Factor | Impact | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| DRIL >500µm | ~6 letters worse | Strong |
| Disrupted EZ | ~10 letters worse | Strong |
| Disrupted ELM | Reduced recovery | Strong |
| HRF present | ~6.5 letters worse | Moderate |
| INL cysts at baseline | Poor treatment response | Moderate |
| VMA at baseline | Worse improvement | Moderate |

### Treatment Response Predictors

**Good Response Indicators**:
- CST decrease >10% after loading
- Early fluid resolution
- HRF reduction
- No INL cysts at baseline

**Poor Response Indicators**:
- Minimal change after 3-6 injections
- Persistent HRF
- Persistent INL cysts
- Worsening DRIL

## Age-Related Macular Degeneration: Prognostic Summary

### Dry AMD Progression Risk

**High-Risk Biomarkers** (OR for Late AMD):

| Biomarker | Odds Ratio | Evidence |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| ELM abnormality | 15.42 | High |
| EZ abnormality | 10.8 | High |
| IZ abnormality | 7.68 | High |
| Large drusen + RPD | HR 6.73 | High |
| Hyporeflective drusen cores | Significant | High |
| IHRF | Significant | High |

**Progression Risk Categories**:
- **High**: Large drusen + RPD + IHRF + outer retinal changes
- **Moderate**: Large drusen or RPD alone with one other factor
- **Lower**: Medium drusen, no high-risk features

### Neovascular AMD Prognostic Factors

**Positive Prognostic Indicators**:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Intact EZ at baseline | Better final VA |
| SRF (vs. IRF) | Relatively better prognosis |
| HRF resolution with treatment | Good responder |
| Early treatment response | Better outcomes |
| Type 2 MNV (vs. Type 1) | May respond well |

**Negative Prognostic Indicators**:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| IRF at baseline/persistent | Associated with worse VA, fibrosis risk |
| Persistent HRF | Non-responder marker |
| Fibrosis development | Poor final VA |
| Large PED | May limit response |
| Type 3 MNV | High fellow eye risk |
| Atrophy development | Limits VA ceiling |

### Fluid Compartment Significance

| Compartment | Prognostic Value |
|-------------|------------------|
| IRF | Negative; associated with worse VA, fibrosis |
| SRF | Neutral to slightly positive; may be tolerable |
| Sub-RPE | Variable; complete resolution often not achievable |

## Retinal Vascular Occlusion: Prognostic Summary

### Evidence-Based Predictors (Systematic Review 2025)

| Biomarker | Timepoint | Prognosis if Intact |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| ELM integrity | 6 months | Better VA (Low certainty) |
| EZ integrity | 12 months | Better VA (Low certainty) |

**Note**: Evidence certainty limited by study heterogeneity

### Additional Prognostic Factors

**Favorable**:
- BRVO (vs. CRVO)
- Non-ischemic type
- Normal FAZ
- Limited capillary nonperfusion
- Intact outer retinal bands
- Minimal DRIL

**Unfavorable**:
- Ischemic CRVO
- Enlarged/irregular FAZ
- Extensive nonperfusion
- DRIL in central mm
- Disrupted EZ/ELM
- Macular ischemia + edema

## Central Serous Chorioretinopathy: Prognostic Summary

### Recovery Predictors

**Favorable**:
- Acute presentation
- First episode
- Intact photoreceptors (EZ)
- Short duration of SRF
- Absence of subretinal deposits
- Normal choroidal features in fellow eye

**Unfavorable**:
- Chronic course (>4-6 months)
- Recurrent episodes
- EZ disruption
- Subretinal deposits
- Significant RPE atrophy
- Development of MNV

### OCT Biomarkers for Prognosis

| Parameter | Favorable | Unfavorable |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| EZ | Intact | Disrupted |
| SRF density | Low | High with deposits |
| Duration | <3 months | >6 months |
| ONL thickness | Preserved | Thinned |
| Subretinal deposits | Absent | Present |

## Macular Telangiectasia Type 2: Prognostic Factors

### Disease Progression Indicators

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Cavitation extent | Correlates with functional loss |
| EZ disruption extent | Correlates with scotoma |
| SRNV development | Stage 4, may need treatment |
| Bilateral progression | Expected; monitor both eyes |

**Note**: No treatment alters non-neovascular MacTel progression

## Treatment Decision Support

### When Prognostic Factors Suggest Poor Response

**Options to Consider**:
1. Switch anti-VEGF agent
2. Add/switch to steroid therapy
3. Combination therapy
4. Address contributing factors (VMT, ERM)
5. Manage patient expectations

### When to Counsel for Limited Visual Potential

**Findings indicating limited recovery**:
- Extensive DRIL
- Complete EZ loss
- Complete ELM loss
- Established fibrosis
- Significant macular ischemia
- Long-standing edema

---

## Prognostic Communication Framework

### Counseling Points by Finding

**Favorable Anatomy**:
- "The structural layers important for vision appear intact"
- "Treatment has a good chance of improving or stabilizing vision"
- "Response to treatment looks promising"

**Unfavorable Anatomy**:
- "There is some damage to the vision-sensing layers"
- "Treatment can help prevent further damage but may not fully restore vision"
- "The underlying structure suggests the vision potential may be limited"

**Mixed Picture**:
- "Some structures look good, others show damage"
- "Treatment is likely to help, but the final outcome is uncertain"
- "Close monitoring will help us understand how things are progressing"
