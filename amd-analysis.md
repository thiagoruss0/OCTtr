# Age-Related Macular Degeneration: OCT Analysis Protocol

## Overview

OCT is the primary imaging modality for AMD diagnosis, staging, monitoring, and treatment guidance. This protocol covers both non-neovascular (dry) and neovascular (wet) AMD assessment.

---

## AMD Classification (Beckman/AAO)

### Categories Based on Drusen

| Category | Definition | Management |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Normal aging | Small drusen ≤63µm only | Routine care |
| Early AMD | Medium drusen >63µm, ≤125µm; No pigment changes | Monitor, supplements |
| Intermediate AMD | Large drusen >125µm; and/or pigment abnormalities | Close monitoring, AREDS2 |
| Late AMD | Geographic atrophy OR neovascular AMD | Active management |

---

## Dry AMD Assessment

### Drusen Characterization

**Size Classification**:
- Small (drupelets): ≤63µm
- Medium: >63µm to ≤125µm
- Large: >125µm

**OCT Drusen Features**:
| Feature | Appearance | Significance |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| Location | Between RPE and Bruch's membrane | Typical drusen |
| Shape | Dome-shaped elevations of RPE | Standard |
| Borders | Soft (indistinct) vs. Hard (distinct) | Soft = higher risk |
| Internal reflectivity | Homogeneous vs. heterogeneous | Heterogeneous = higher risk |
| Hyporeflective cores | Dark centers within drusen | Associated with progression |

**Drusen Volume**: Quantifiable on some platforms; higher volume = higher risk

---

### Reticular Pseudodrusen (RPD) / Subretinal Drusenoid Deposits (SDD)

**Location**: Between EZ and RPE (subretinal space)

**OCT Appearance**:
- Hyperreflective material above RPE
- Disrupts EZ continuity
- Best seen on horizontal B-scans
- Multiple small deposits in affected areas

**Significance**:
- Higher risk of progression to late AMD
- Associated with outer retinal atrophy
- Particularly associated with GA development
- May be missed on fundus photography alone

---

### High-Risk Biomarkers for Progression

**Evidence-Based Risk Factors** (Systematic Review/Meta-analysis):

| Biomarker | OR for Late AMD | Evidence Level |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| ELM abnormality | 15.42 | High |
| EZ abnormality | 10.8 | High |
| IZ abnormality | 7.68 | High |
| Large drusen + RPD | HR 6.73 | High |
| Hyporeflective drusen cores | Significant | High |
| IHRF (Intraretinal HRF) | Significant | High |

---

### Intraretinal Hyperreflective Foci (IHRF)

**Definition**: HRF located within retinal layers, overlying drusen

**Significance**:
- Represents migrating RPE cells
- Strong predictor of progression to GA
- Part of nascent GA definition
- May precede visible atrophy by months

**Assessment**:
- Present/Absent
- Location relative to drusen
- Associated outer retinal changes

---

### Geographic Atrophy (GA)

**OCT Definition (CAM Classification)**:
- Hypertransmission into choroid (increased signal)
- Loss of RPE band
- Photoreceptor degeneration (EZ/ELM loss)
- Outer retinal thinning

**Complete Atrophy Requirements**:
1. Region ≥250µm diameter
2. Hypertransmission into choroid
3. Evidence of overlying photoreceptor degeneration
4. Absence of scrolled RPE or other signs of RPE tear

**Nascent GA**:
- Subsidence of OPL and INL
- Hyporeflective wedge in Henle fiber layer
- IHRF present
- May progress to complete atrophy

---

## Neovascular AMD Assessment

### MNV Classification on OCT

**Type 1 MNV (Sub-RPE, Occult)**:
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Location | Between RPE and Bruch's membrane |
| PED | Fibrovascular PED (irregular, heterogeneous) |
| Double-layer sign | Hyperreflective line within/below PED |
| Fluid | SRF common; IRF indicates chronicity |
| RPE | Elevated, may be irregular |

**Type 2 MNV (Subretinal, Classic)**:
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Location | Between neurosensory retina and RPE |
| Appearance | Hyperreflective material above RPE |
| Fluid | SRF common |
| "Mushroom" | If both sub-RPE and subretinal components |

**Type 3 MNV (Intraretinal, RAP)**:
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Location | Originates within retina |
| PED | Serous PED common |
| IRF | Prominent intraretinal cysts |
| Progression | Extends toward RPE/choroid |
| Fellow eye risk | High |

---

### Fluid Assessment in nAMD

**Subretinal Fluid (SRF)**:
- Hyporeflective space between neurosensory retina and RPE
- Generally better prognostic marker than IRF
- Small amounts may be tolerable in some treat-and-extend protocols

**Intraretinal Fluid (IRF)**:
- Cystic spaces within retinal layers
- Negative prognostic indicator
- Associated with worse VA outcomes
- Higher risk of fibrosis/atrophy development

**Sub-RPE Fluid**:
- Within PED
- May persist despite treatment
- Complete resolution not always achievable

---

### Activity Markers in nAMD

**Signs of Active Disease**:
- New or increased SRF
- New or increased IRF
- New or increased PED
- Retinal thickening
- New hemorrhage (if visible on OCT as hyperreflective)
- Increase in HRF

**Signs of Quiescence**:
- Stable anatomy over multiple visits
- No new fluid
- Stable or resolved PED
- Fibrotic scar formation (end-stage)

---

### Treatment Response Biomarkers

**Positive Response Indicators**:
- Fluid resolution (especially IRF)
- PED height reduction
- Decreased retinal thickness
- HRF reduction
- Stable/improving EZ

**Poor Response Indicators**:
- Persistent IRF after 3+ injections
- Persistent numerous HRF
- Progressive EZ disruption
- Developing fibrosis (hyperreflective mass)
- Developing atrophy

---

### Fibrosis and Atrophy in nAMD

**Fibrotic Scar**:
- Hyperreflective subretinal/sub-RPE mass
- Loss of normal retinal layer architecture
- Often associated with overlying retinal atrophy
- End-stage, irreversible

**Macular Atrophy in nAMD**:
- Can develop despite treatment
- Higher risk with persistent IRF
- May appear as treatment effect or disease progression

## Pigment Epithelial Detachment (PED) Analysis

### PED Types

| Type | OCT Appearance | Association |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| Serous | Dome-shaped, homogeneous hyporeflective | CSC, Type 3 MNV |
| Fibrovascular | Irregular, heterogeneous, moderately reflective | Type 1 MNV |
| Drusenoid | Shallow, drusen-like material | Dry AMD |
| Hemorrhagic | Hyperreflective, dense, shadowing | Acute bleed |

### PED Measurements
- Height
- Width
- Volume (if available)
- Monitor for RPE tear risk in tall PEDs

---

## Monitoring Protocol

### High-Risk Dry AMD
- Every 3-6 months depending on risk factors
- Home monitoring (Amsler, ForeseeHome if available)
- Prompt evaluation for new symptoms

### Active nAMD on Treatment
- Monthly during loading phase
- Per treat-and-extend protocol thereafter
- Immediate for sudden vision change

### Stable nAMD
- Follow per T&E protocol
- Monitor for recurrence signs
- Watch for atrophy development
