# OCT Interpretation Guidelines

## Systematic Approach to OCT Analysis

A structured, systematic approach ensures comprehensive evaluation and reduces missed findings.

---

## Pre-Analysis Checklist

### 1. Patient Information
- [ ] Correct patient identification
- [ ] Eye laterality confirmed (OD/OS)
- [ ] Date of examination
- [ ] Comparison studies available

### 2. Scan Parameters
- [ ] Scan type (macular cube, line scan, radial)
- [ ] Scan protocol appropriate for indication
- [ ] Both eyes scanned when relevant

### 3. Image Quality Assessment

**Signal Strength Thresholds**:
| Device | Acceptable | Optimal |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Cirrus (Zeiss) | >6 | >8 |
| Spectralis (Heidelberg) | >15 (Q score) | >25 |
| Optovue | >40 | >60 |

**Quality Factors to Assess**:
- Signal strength metric
- Centration on fovea
- Motion artifacts
- Blink artifacts
- Media clarity effects

## Structured Interpretation Protocol

### Step 1: Global Overview

**Thickness Map Review**:
- Identify areas of abnormal thickness
- Compare to normative database
- Note symmetry between zones
- Review ETDRS grid values

**En Face Images**:
- Correlate with B-scan findings
- Identify extent of pathology
- Compare to fundus photography

---

### Step 2: B-Scan Analysis (Layer by Layer)

**Anterior Surface**:
- Vitreous: Posterior vitreous detachment status, opacities
- Vitreoretinal interface: Adhesion, traction, membrane

**Inner Retinal Layers**:
- ILM: Continuous, membrane, wrinkling
- RNFL/GCL/IPL: Thickness, reflectivity
- INL: Cysts, thickness
- OPL: Visible, obscured by edema
- DRIL assessment in central zone

**Outer Retinal Layers**:
- ONL: Thickness, cysts
- ELM: Intact, disrupted, absent
- EZ: Intact, disrupted, absent
- IZ: Visible, abnormal
- RPE: Elevation, irregularity, atrophy

**Subretinal Space**:
- SRF: Present, extent, deposits
- Subretinal material: Hemorrhage, fibrosis, neovascularization

**Sub-RPE Space**:
- PED: Type, dimensions
- Drusen: Size, type
- Sub-RPE fluid or material

**Choroid** (if EDI/SS-OCT):
- Thickness measurement
- Vessel appearance
- Focal abnormalities

---

### Step 3: Quantitative Assessment

**Standard Measurements**:
| Parameter | How to Measure | Normal Range |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| CST | Central 1mm ETDRS | Device-specific |
| Total macular volume | Automated | Device-specific |
| SFCT | RPE to choroid-sclera interface | 190-350µm |
| DRIL extent | Within central 1mm | Absent |
| PED height | Base of RPE to peak | N/A |
| SRF height | Outer retina to RPE | Absent |

---

### Step 4: Comparison to Prior Studies

**Change Assessment**:
- Thickness changes (absolute and percentage)
- Fluid changes (new, resolved, stable)
- Structural progression or improvement
- Treatment response evaluation

**Progression Analysis**:
- Use device progression software when available
- Serial comparison of B-scans
- Trend analysis for chronic conditions

---

## Disease-Specific Focus Points

### Diabetic Macular Edema
1. Center involvement
2. DRIL in central mm
3. EZ/ELM integrity
4. HRF presence
5. Cyst location (INL vs ONL)
6. VMI abnormalities

### AMD (Dry)
1. Drusen size and distribution
2. RPD/SDD presence
3. IHRF over drusen
4. Outer retinal band integrity
5. GA presence and extent

### AMD (Wet)
1. MNV type classification
2. Fluid compartments (IRF, SRF, sub-RPE)
3. PED characteristics
4. Activity markers
5. Fibrosis/atrophy

### Retinal Vascular Occlusion
1. Edema extent and pattern
2. DRIL assessment
3. EZ/ELM integrity
4. Ischemia indicators
5. Hemorrhage location

### Pachychoroid/CSC
1. Choroidal thickness
2. Pachyvessel presence
3. SRF characteristics
4. Acute vs chronic features
5. MNV signs

## Reporting Standards

### Essential Report Elements

**Objective Findings**:
- Quantitative measurements
- Biomarker documentation
- Comparison to prior (if available)
- Quality assessment notation

**Clinical Correlation**:
- Findings consistent with clinical diagnosis
- Discrepancies to address
- Additional imaging recommended

**Assessment**:
- Primary findings summary
- Activity status (active, quiescent, resolved)
- Change from prior (improved, stable, worsened)

**Plan/Recommendations**:
- Follow-up interval
- Treatment considerations
- Additional studies needed

---

## Quality Assurance Practices

### Verification Steps
1. Review raw B-scans, not just reports
2. Check segmentation accuracy
3. Verify measurements manually if questionable
4. Correlate with clinical examination
5. Compare to prior studies systematically

### Red Flags for Repeat Imaging
- Signal strength below threshold
- Significant motion artifacts
- Decentration affecting measurements
- Segmentation errors
- Media opacity degrading quality

---

## Common Interpretation Pitfalls

### Technical Pitfalls
- Relying solely on automated reports
- Missing segmentation errors
- Ignoring signal strength
- Not reviewing all B-scans

### Clinical Pitfalls
- Confirmation bias (expecting specific findings)
- Missing bilateral disease
- Overlooking subtle changes
- Not correlating with clinical exam

### Disease-Specific Pitfalls
- MacTel mistaken for CME
- CSC mistaken for nAMD
- ERM obscuring underlying pathology
- Artifact mimicking pathology

See `../troubleshooting/artifacts-pitfalls.md` for detailed guidance

## Documentation Best Practices

### Biomarker Checklist by Disease

**Universal Checklist**:
- [ ] Signal quality adequate
- [ ] CST measured
- [ ] EZ status documented
- [ ] ELM status documented
- [ ] Fluid status (IRF, SRF) documented
- [ ] Comparison to prior noted

**DME-Specific Additions**:
- [ ] DRIL extent
- [ ] HRF presence
- [ ] Center involvement status
- [ ] VMI status

**AMD-Specific Additions**:
- [ ] Drusen/RPD documented
- [ ] IHRF if applicable
- [ ] MNV type (if nAMD)
- [ ] Activity status

## Workflow Integration

### Efficient Review Process

1. **Quick Scan** (30 seconds)
   - Quality check
   - Thickness map overview
   - Obvious abnormalities

2. **Detailed Review** (2-3 minutes)
   - Systematic B-scan analysis
   - Quantitative measurements
   - Comparison to prior

3. **Synthesis** (1 minute)
   - Correlate findings
   - Formulate impression
   - Document recommendations

### Time-Saving Tips
- Use device summary reports as starting point
- Flag studies needing detailed review
- Develop consistent documentation templates
- Use comparison features effectively
