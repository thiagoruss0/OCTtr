# Pachychoroid Spectrum Diseases: OCT Analysis Protocol

## Overview

The pachychoroid spectrum comprises a group of chorioretinal disorders characterized by abnormal choroidal thickening, dilated outer choroidal vessels (pachyvessels), and choriocapillaris compromise. Understanding these conditions is essential for appropriate diagnosis and management.

---

## Spectrum Entities

### 1. Pachychoroid Pigment Epitheliopathy (PPE)
- Earliest/mildest form
- RPE changes over areas of pachychoroid
- No SRF (distinguishes from CSC)
- May be precursor to other entities

### 2. Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC)
- Subretinal fluid accumulation
- Acute vs. chronic forms
- Most recognized pachychoroid entity
- Can resolve spontaneously (acute)

### 3. Pachychoroid Neovasculopathy (PNV)
- Type 1 MNV in pachychoroid setting
- Minimal/absent drusen (unlike typical AMD)
- Younger patients than typical nAMD
- May evolve from CSC

### 4. Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV)
- Also: Aneurysmal Type 1 Neovascularization
- Polypoidal lesions with branching vascular network
- More common in Asian populations
- Part of Type 1 MNV spectrum

### 5. Focal Choroidal Excavation (FCE)
- Focal concavity in choroid
- May coexist with other pachychoroid entities
- Can be associated with CSC or MNV

### 6. Peripapillary Pachychoroid Syndrome (PPS)
- Nasal/peripapillary pachychoroid
- May cause optic disc edema or peripapillary SRF
- Less common presentation

## Key OCT Features

### Choroidal Assessment (Requires EDI or SS-OCT)

**Subfoveal Choroidal Thickness (SFCT)**:
| Measurement | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| <300µm | Generally normal range |
| 300-350µm | Borderline/consider pachychoroid |
| >350µm | Likely pachychoroid |
| >389µm | Machine learning cutoff for pachychoroid |

**Important Note**: Choroidal thickness varies with:
- Age (decreases with age)
- Axial length (thinner in myopia)
- Time of day (diurnal variation)
- Systemic factors

---

### Pachyvessels

**Definition**: Dilated outer choroidal (Haller's layer) vessels

**OCT Appearance**:
- Large, prominent vessels in outer choroid
- Occupy expanded choroidal space
- Often best seen on EDI or SS-OCT

**Significance**:
- Diagnostic even with normal overall thickness
- Indicates choroidal venous dysfunction
- Associated choriocapillaris attenuation above

---

### Choriocapillaris Attenuation

**Description**:
- Thinning of inner choroidal layers
- Occurs over pachyvessels
- Hypoperfusion leads to RPE dysfunction

**OCT Appearance**:
- Reduced hyporeflective space between RPE and large vessels
- Best assessed with enhanced depth imaging

---

### RPE Changes

**Findings in Pachychoroid**:
- RPE irregularity
- Small PEDs
- RPE bumps
- Pigment migration

---

## Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC)

### Acute CSC

**OCT Features**:
| Finding | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| SRF | Dome-shaped detachment of neurosensory retina |
| Choroid | Thick (pachychoroid features) |
| PED | May have small PED at leak site |
| Photoreceptors | Usually preserved |
| Subretinal deposits | Absent |

**Prognosis**: Usually resolves spontaneously within 3-6 months

---

### Chronic CSC

**OCT Features**:
| Finding | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| SRF | Persistent >4-6 months, may be shallow |
| Subretinal deposits | Present (hyperreflective material in SRF) |
| Photoreceptors | Often damaged (EZ disruption) |
| RPE | Irregular, may show atrophic changes |
| Choroid | Thick, but may be less than acute |

**Prognosis**: Variable; may need treatment; photoreceptor damage affects outcome

---

### Differentiating Acute vs. Chronic

| Feature | Acute CSC | Chronic CSC |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Duration | <4-6 months | >4-6 months |
| SRF | Dome-shaped, clear | Often irregular, may have deposits |
| Subretinal deposits | Absent | Present |
| EZ/photoreceptors | Intact | Often disrupted |
| Visual recovery | Usually complete | May be incomplete |
| Treatment | Observation initially | Often requires intervention |

---

### CSC vs. nAMD Differentiation

| Feature | CSC | nAMD |
|---------|-----|------|
| Age | Often younger (40-50s) | Older (>60) |
| Drusen | Absent/minimal | Usually present |
| Choroid | Thick | Variable |
| SRF | Primary finding | May be present |
| IRF | Rare | Common in nAMD |
| PED | Small, serous | Often fibrovascular |

---

## Pachychoroid Neovasculopathy (PNV)

### OCT Features

**Identifying Characteristics**:
- Type 1 MNV (sub-RPE neovascularization)
- Flat irregular PED
- Double-layer sign
- Minimal/absent drusen
- Thick choroid with pachyvessels

**Distinguishing from Typical nAMD**:
| Feature | PNV | Typical nAMD |
|---------|-----|--------------|
| Drusen | Minimal/absent | Usually present |
| Choroid | Thick | Often normal/thin |
| Age | May be younger | Typically >65 |
| Pachyvessels | Present | Usually absent |

---

## Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV)

### OCT Features

**Characteristic Findings**:
- Polyps: Round/oval hyperreflective lesions under RPE
- Branching vascular network (BVN): Flat irregular PED
- Sharp PED peak ("thumb-like" protrusion)
- Double-layer sign
- May have hemorrhagic PED

**OCTA Utility**:
- Visualizes BVN and polyps
- Helps distinguish from typical Type 1 MNV

---

## Focal Choroidal Excavation (FCE)

### OCT Features

**Characteristics**:
- Focal depression/excavation in choroid
- RPE conforms to excavation
- May have SRF if associated with CSC
- May develop MNV

**Types**:
1. **Conforming**: Photoreceptors follow contour
2. **Non-conforming**: SRF in excavation

---

## Diagnostic Algorithm

### Step 1: Assess Choroidal Thickness
- Use EDI or SS-OCT
- Measure SFCT
- Identify pachyvessels

### Step 2: Evaluate RPE/Subretinal Space
- SRF present? → Consider CSC
- PED type? → Serous, fibrovascular, drusenoid
- RPE irregularity?

### Step 3: Look for Neovascularization
- Double-layer sign
- OCTA if available
- PNV vs. PCV features

### Step 4: Classify
| Finding | Classification |
|---------|----------------|
| Pachychoroid + RPE changes only | PPE |
| Pachychoroid + SRF | CSC |
| Pachychoroid + Type 1 MNV | PNV |
| Pachychoroid + polyps | PCV |

---

## Monitoring Protocol

### Acute CSC
- Re-evaluate at 1-3 months
- Many resolve spontaneously
- Consider treatment if persistent >3-4 months

### Chronic CSC
- Active monitoring during treatment
- Watch for progression/complications
- Monitor photoreceptor status

### PNV/PCV
- Similar to nAMD monitoring
- Treat-and-extend protocols
- May require combination therapy (anti-VEGF + PDT for PCV)

- First episode

**Unfavorable**:
- Chronic course
- EZ disruption
- Recurrent episodes

---

## Treatment Considerations

### CSC
- Observation (acute, first episode)
- Half-fluence PDT (chronic)
- Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (investigational)
- Avoid systemic corticosteroids

### PNV
- Anti-VEGF therapy
- Similar to nAMD management

### PCV
